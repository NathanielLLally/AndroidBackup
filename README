android backup utility
modelled after tar
repo: git@github.com:NathanielLLally/AndroidBackup.git
cpan: Archive::AndroidBackup

this project perhaps may be able to read and create ab files, but primary, 
it was born from the desire to copy files from system protected areas
on certain android devices.  if you cannot flash a rom or gain permission
in an applications private area to read or write files, try creating and
restoring an android backup file- for details see below

there is a java utility named the Android Backup Extractor which can be found
here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor/

and another java tool here:
https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor

the frontend script is named abk
(apache people took 'ab' with the benchmarking tool, and mr Elenkov's tool is
  'abe')

  abk [op] file [dir]
    -t list table of contents
    -c create android backup named file from dir
    -x extract
    -v and list toc 

for those not yet aquainted with this android afterthought and wonderfully
clandestine way of transferring private application files, see the following
sample windows session:

NOTE: obtaining and setting up android developer bridge (adb) is out of scope
yet can be known from the listed references below

1: obtain the program's namespace

  adb shell pm list packages | find /I "baldur"

2: create a backup (see xda-devs article below for more info)

  adb backup -f bgeesave.ab com.beamdog.baldursgateenhancededition

3: extract

  abk -xv bgeesave.ab

...

4: create a new ab file from filesystem
  
  abk -c newsave.ab apps/

5: restore the backup

  adb restore newsave.ab
